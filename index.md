I examine how regulations and market structures shape innovation strategies in knowledge-intensive industries. My research reveals how transparency mandates, intellectual property regimes, and venture capital concentration influence firms' R&D decisionsâ€”from geographic allocation and risk-taking to the fundamental choice between breakthrough and incremental innovation. Through studies of pharmaceutical development and entrepreneurial finance, I investigate the unintended consequences of institutional forces on technological progress and competitive dynamics.
