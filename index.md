<h2 id="research-interests" style="font-size:2rem;">research interests</h2>
I specialize in exploring the relationships between regulations, innovation, and competitive strategies. My research predominantly centers on the pharmaceutical industry, in which I apply frameworks from industrial organization economics and strategic management to understand how regulatory landscapes influence firms' strategic decision-making. Another strand of my research investigates how gender differences in personal traits shape human capital allocation and workforce dynamics.
