I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in managerial economics and strategy at Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland. I am on the 2025-2026 job market, actively seeking a tenure-track position in strategic management and entrepreneurship.

## Research Interests

I specialize in exploring the relationships between regulations, innovation, and competitive strategies. My research predominantly centers on the pharmaceutical industry, in which I apply frameworks from industrial organization economics and strategic management to understand how regulatory landscapes influence firms' strategic decision-making. Another strand of my research investigates how gender differences in personal traits shape human capital allocation and workforce dynamics.
